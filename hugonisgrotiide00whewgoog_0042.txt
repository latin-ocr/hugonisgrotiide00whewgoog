32 Du PROMISSIS. [lua II.

missum est, sod quod interest: ceterum pacta, quam ex se
non hahent vim, som aeeipsre aut ex contractibus, quibus
insunt aut adjiciuntur, aut ex rei traditionez unde nasci par-
tim actiones, partim exceptiones, et vetitam repetitionem.

Qum vero pacta vim obligandi seeundum leges habeant, ut

. pecte stipulata, et alia quedam, habere eam legum beneficio,
quarum ea est efficacia, ιιι quod per se honestum est, id efficere
possint etiam necessarium.

3 Verum hoec sententia, ita generaliter ut ab ipso oller-
tur accepta, consistere nou potest Primum enim seqnitur
inde inter reges et populos diversos, pactorum quamdiu nihil
ex iis prestitum est, vim esse nullam, prasertim iis in loeis,

· ubi nulla certa forma foederum aut sponsionum reperta est
Tum vero ratio nulla reperiri potest, cur leges, quae quasi pse,
tum commune sunt populi, atque hoc nomine vocantur ab

(palm, voluntas autem cujusque, hoo omni modo agentis nt se obliget,

affert. Adde quod, voluntate sufficienter significata, mans-
ferri rei dominium potest, ut ante diximus: quidni ergo

having been taken, he pronounces that what you ought to do, is not

what is promised, but what is for the interest of the promisca—that the
pacta, not having any force of themselves, receive force from the con-
trnets ef which they are parts or additions, or from the delivery of the ⁴
thing in quostiam whence ariae, partly actions, partly exceptione to
actions, and prohibitione of suit,

'But pacta which have an obligatory force according ιο the Laws,
as pacta with stipulatione and some ethera have, he holds, this force
by the help of the lawa, which have this efficacy, that what of itselfis
proper, they make to be necessary.

3 But this opinion cannot stand, in tho general form in which hs
propounds it. Fer, ln the first place, it follows therefrom that pacta
between kings and different peoples, so long as nothing thereos is per·
formed (re integret) have no sorce3 [the parties being bound byrro
common instituted law 3] especially in those places in which no regular
form of treaties and engagemeuts has been introduced.

And sguira no reason can be found why laws, which are in a cer.
tain way a common pact of the peeple, and are so called by Aristotlo
and Demosthenes, should be able ιο give obligatory force ιο pacts;
while the will of a persen directed especially, aud by every means, to
put himself under an obligation, should not be able to do ιο ; especially
when the (livii haw offers no impediment.
