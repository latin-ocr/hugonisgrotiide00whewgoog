ΙΙΙ. Primum enim apparet, bona fidei possessorem (nam ’ἥξω
malae fidei possessor, ultra rei rationem, ex facto suo mnetur) Ξξῗιξᾞῖα ”
non teneri ad ullam restitutionem si res perierit: quia nec res ffliiis

ipsa apud eum cst, nec lucrum ex re.

lV. Secundo, bonae fidei possessorem teucri ad restituen-
dos ³ctiam fructus exstantes rei: dico frustm τοίς nam indus-
trias fructus etiam si sine re non procederent, rei tamen nou
debentur. Causa hujus obligationis est ex dominio: nam qui

ΙΙΙ. In the first place, it appears that a bono fide possessor is not
bound to any restitution, ii the thing be destroyed ; for ho neither
has the thing nor any gain from the thing: [a mala fide possessoris
bound by his own act, besides the consequences of wrong doing]

IV. Secondly, a bono fide possessoris bound to restore also the
still extant produco of the thing: I say the produce oi the thirty,-
t'or tho produco of industry, owen if it would not take piace without
the thing, is not due to the thing. The cause of this obligation is
ownership: for he who is owner of a thing is naturally owner οἰ
the fruits of the thing.

V. Thirdly‚ theta oona fide possessor is bound to restitution
both of the thing and oi the produce oi it consumcd by him, ii in
