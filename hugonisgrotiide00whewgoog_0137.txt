contractus inest, natura obligationem multo strictiorem desi-
derat Nam qui contrahendo aliquid de suo dat, aut promittit,
is vicissim prestari reipsa sibi aliquid vult; undeet jure civili,
quod iacti alieni promissiones repudiat, promissio amen ratam
rem haberi ad id quod interest obstringit.

IV. Federa Menippus regis Antiochi ad Romanos Lega-
tus, referente ‘¹Livio‚ magis ex usu suo quam ex praescripto& cip miv.
artis ita divisit, ιιι diceret tria esse eorum sedarum, quae ἰιιιοι·ω
se paciscerentur reges civitatesque, genera: unum cum bello
victis dicerentur leges, quo in genere quid victum habere,
quo mulctari eum vellet, victoris esse arbitrium: alterum, cum
pares bello aequo federe in pacem atque amicitiam venirentz
tunc repeti reddique per conventionem res, et si quarum tur-
bata bello possessio sit, eas aut ex formula juris antiqui, aut ex
partis utriusque commodo componi: tertium esse genus, cum
qui hostes nunquam inerint ad amicitiam sociah federe inter
se jungendam cebant: quos nec dicere leges, nec accipere.

made a convention respecting something which belongs to the rights ·
oi the people, let us soc to what they aro bound. It may bo thought
perhaps that, in ibiscum, thc party who made the convention have
performed their engagement, if they hnvo donc all that was possible for
them, that the tcrms of the convention on their part should be iul·

But the nature of these affairs, which involve a contr-act and not a
mero promise, requires a much strictcr obligation. For he who in a
coutract gives anything of his own, or promises it, expects soma-
thing te be donc for him by the other side: whence by the civil Law
also, which repudiatas promises for thc acts of others, yet a promise
cf the agent binde and is validae sar as he is concernod.

IV. In Livy, Menippus, rather fer his purpose than scientifically,
divides Treatics between Kings and States into three kinds3 trcaties
of a conqueror in war with the conqueret, and in these tho torma
depcnd on the will of the victor: trcatics oi peuce between parties
who end a war with equid successe and hcrc the terma are equal,
