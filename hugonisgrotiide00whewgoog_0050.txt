Similiter ergo dicemus, hsi promissio fundata sit in praesum-
tione quadam facti quod non ita se habeat, naturaliter nullam
ojus esse vim: quia omnine promissor non consensit in pro-
missum, nisi sub quedam conditione quae re ipsa non extitit:
quo referenda est illa quaestio apud Ciceronem dc Oratore

instituerat heredem.

ant in sensu suo exprimendo, ⁵et damnum inde alter passus
sit, tenebitur id resarcire promissor, non ex si promissionis,

promise is founded on the presumption of some fact which is net really
