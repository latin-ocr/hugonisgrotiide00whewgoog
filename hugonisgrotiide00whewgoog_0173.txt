Onia XVI] DE INTERPRETATIONE. 167

adscitos defendere non licuit? Imo vero licuit, non ex vi
federis, sed ex jure naturali, quod federe non erat abdicatum:
its ιιι Saguntini apud utrosque eo essent loco, quasi nihil de
sociis convenisset: quo casu nec Carthaginienses contra fedus

erant facturi, si in Saguntinos arma moverent quse justa
arbitrarentur, nec Romani si eos defenderent. Plane sicut
Pyrrhi tempore inter Carthaginienses et Romanos conre-
nerat, ut si eorum populorum alter cnm Pyrrho fedus faceret, Μ 11¹·t
ita faceret ιιι jus auxilia mittendi ei, quem Pyrrhus bello
impeteret, salsum maneret Non dico justum utrinque bellum

tionem: quomodo in quaestione de auxilio Mamertinis misso
a Romanis distinguit Polybius, an justum id fuerit, et an per usust

dicunt Atheniensibus, licere ipsis sibi auxilia mittere, nechim

into albanos, or when allisd, to defend them? certainly this was
lawfuI, notin virtue of the lesgue, but in virtue oi Natural Low,
which they had not abdicated by the treatyr so that the Saguntines
should be in the same situation as if no convention had been mado
about allics: in which csse the Carthaginians would not be acting
against the losguo, if thoy made what they conceived ιο bc a just war
against the Saguntinos3 nor the Romans, ii they defended thern: just
as at the time oi Pyrrhus, an agreement was made between the Gar-
thaginians ond Romans, that ii either oi those Peoplcs mado a lcaguo
with Pyrrhus, it should be lnwful ior the other to do so likewise. 1
do not say tho war could hare been just on both sides ; but Ι dcny
that this point had to do with the violetion of the lcaguc: ns in the
question conceruing the Mamertinos, Polybius distinguishcs the points,
whether it was just, and whether it was consistent with tho loague.

3 And this is exactly what the corcyrcsns in Thucydides say to tho
Atheniens, that it is lawiul for them ιο send aid to thom, and that it
is not an obJection, that the Athenians had a ieague with the Lacedse·
moninus, since by that lesgne it was lawiul to acquire now ellios.
