Cur. xlv] DE EORUM QUI SUMMUM IMPERIUM, ETC. 113

frondoso dolo, sive errore circumventum, sive metu, restitui
posse, ex quibus subditus restitueretur, tum in iis quoe sd jura
mejestatis imminutoe, tum in iis quae ed privetu commodo per·
tinent Addit, ne jurejurando quidem teneri regem, si ejus·
modi sint puoto conventus quibus discedere lex potietur,
etiamsi pactu honestati sint consentaneo: non enim ideo teneri
quis juraverit, sed quic justis conventionibus quisque teneatur,
quatenus alterius intersit

2 Nos, ut nlibi distinximus, its hic quoque distinguen-
dum censemus iuter sotus Regis qui regii sunt, et sotus ejus·
dem privatos. Num in regiis actibus quae rex fucit eo loco
habendo sunt, quusi communitas iaceret: in tales autem actus
sicut leges ab ipsu communitate sectio vim nullum haberent,
quie communitus seipsa superior non est, itu nec leges regie.
Quare adversus hos contractus restitutio locum non hebebit:
venit enim illu ex jure civili. Non admittenda igitur exceptio
regum adversus contractus quos minores fecissent

hs ιο the first houd, it is made a question whether the king, us he
een relieve hie subjecte from un ooth, cun do the seme to himself, end
put himself beck into his original condition. Bodinus thinks thst the
king moy be so reinstuted on tho sume grounds ss u subject would bo
so; whether he heve been circumvented by tho fraud end deception
of another perty, or by his own error, or iear3 und thie, both in
metten which effect the rights of the sovereignty, und thoeo which
pertsin ιο private cdvsntsge. He adds, thet the king is not even
bourm by sn esth, if the conventione made ure of thet kind from
which the lsw permits parties to recede, even though the agreement
iscont'ormsble to propriety3 for (he holds) heis not therefore bound,
becsm he hus sworn, but because every one is bound by just con-
ventione, so fur es the interest of another is concerncd.

2 We make a distinction here, us we hsvo done in othor places,
between the ecte oi the king which ure royel acts, and acts of tho seme
person which ere private acts. For in royal acts, what the king does
is ιο be held us if it were done by the community: und ss luws mede
by the community itself would heve no force over such acts, becsuee
tho community is not superior to iteelf, so neither hsve lewe mode by
the king uny such force. Thereiore against such contracte, restitution
will not hold: for this restitution is serectute oi the civil Low.
And thus kings ere not relieved from contracte which they had mode
ess minois.
