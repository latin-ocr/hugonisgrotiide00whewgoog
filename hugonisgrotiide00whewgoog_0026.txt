16 QUANDO IMPERIA VEh [Lm. 11.

pependerat) placuit populo Romano, quo certius presidium
haberet, regem non proprium sibi sumere, sed eum quem
Germani fecissent: “ita mmcn ut jus sibi aliquod retineret
probanda vel improbandae electionis, quantum scilicet ea res
ad se pertinebat.

4 Haec quoque approbatio per episcopum edici et solem-
niter testata fieri peculiari coronatione solebat: quare ex elec-
tione septem principum, qui Germanice corpus referunt, qui
lectus est, jus habet imperandi Germanis secundum eorum mo·
res: ex approbatione vero populi Romani fit idem rex, aut
Imperator Romanus, aut, ut historici saepe loquuntur, eItex
regni Italiae: atque eo titulo subse habet quaecumque populi
Romani fuerunt, neque pactionibus, aut derelicti occupatione,
aut victoriae jure in aliorum populorum imperium concesserunts

of Romo, in order that they might he sure of a protector, not to
have a king of their own, but the king whom the Germane had elected:
yet so that they might retain some power of confirming or annulling
the election, eo far as they were concerned.

4 This approbation was want to be proolaimed by the Bishop‚ and
solemnly celebrated byaspecial coronation, [that of King of the Rc-
mans.] Whercfore he who is elected by the Seven Princes who re·
present Germany, has authority to rule orer the Germane according
to their usagee. But the same person is, by the approbation of the
Roman peoplc, made Roman Emperor, or Ktng, or, as historians often
epeak‚ King of the kingdom of Italy. And by that title, ¹10 ¹¹³⁸ under
him whatever belonged to the people of Rome, and that hos not passed
under the authority of other peoplce hy ocmpact, or by occupation of

derelict, or by the right of conquest.
And hence wo easily understand by what right the Bishop of

Rome, during the racancy of the Empire‚ givos tho investituras of
tho fiefe of the Roman Empiro; namely, because he is the first person
io the Roman people, which at that time is free. For whatever
office belongs to any body, ia went to be discharged by the tirst person
of that body, aa wc have elsewhere naid.
