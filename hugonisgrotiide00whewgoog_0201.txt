amicorum rapuissent, desertaque patria mari vagarentur, ac
ne revocati quidem redirent, an rectores eo nomine tenerentur,
aut quod malorum hominum usi essent opera, aut quod cau-
tionem non exegissent. Dixi eos in nihil amplius teneri, quam
ut noxios, si reperiri possent, punirent aut dederent: praeterea

theuto punish and surrender the guilty persons, ifthoy could be sound3
and, besides, to make the goods of the plunderers liable: for that they
had not boen the cause of the unlawful spoliation, nor had in any way
sharcd in it; and had forbidden by law the plunder of friends: that
there was no law obliging them to demand cantion-money, since thoy
