directly caused, by which any one is deprived os a proper right which
he has3 a damage by consequence, that by which any one has not

in Ulpian: It' in my ground I hare opened a well, by which the
springs which would hnvc come ιο you are cut off: he denies that,
by tho effect of my operatione, a wrongful damage is done to you,
since I was using my own right in my own property. Audin another
place, ho says it makes a great difference, whether any one suffer a

when ho says that by the punishment os the parent, the children lose
that which from him would haro como to thch but that which was
