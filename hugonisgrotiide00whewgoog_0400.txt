ιιι elios esset liber, elius senua. Quare qui legitima eausa

ne id te torqueat.

XII. Neque minus iniquum armis subigere aliquos velle,
quasi dignos qui serviant, quos naturaliter servos interdum
philosophi vocant. Non enim siquid alicui est utile, id statim
mihi licet ei pervim imponere. Nam his qui rationis habent
usum libera esse debet utilium et inutilium electio, nisi alteri
jus quoddam ιιι eos quaesitum sit. Infantium plane alia est vinem
ratio, quorum regimen, cum ipsi jus exercendae αυτοπραγὶαι
actionumque suarum moderandarum non habeant, occupanti et
idoneo natura concedit.

so that man is not a slavo by nature, bnt he is not by nature a croa-
ture that cannot be a slave. For in this latter sense, no one is
free. And to thIs view pertains what is said hy Albutius, that No
one is horn free, eud no otte ιι born a clevet these names came
afterwards to belong ιο men by their fortune. So Aristotle says,
that it is a result of law that one man is free, another a slave.
Thercfore they who have, by a legitimate coume, come Into s'avery,
either personul or civil, ought ιο be content with their conditiou; as
St Paul teuchos, Arc thou called being a amenti Cere not sor it.

XII. Nor is it less unjust to wish to subjugate any by arms, as
beiug worthy to be slaves, or as philosophers sometImes speak, natu·
rally slaves. For eren if there be anytthg which is fit ior me, it
does not follow that any oue hus a right to impose iton mo by
force. For those who have the use of reason, ought to have a free
election left them of what is useful to them and what is not, except
another have ιι right orer them. The case is plainly different with
infante, the gorerument of whom, since they themselves hare not tho
right of independent aetion and seli-direction, nature gives to those
who have a olaIm to it, and can exorciso ιι.

XIII. 1 lt would hardly be necessary to notice that the title
