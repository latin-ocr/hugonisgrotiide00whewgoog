(iar. XXIII.] DE CAUSIS DUBIlS. 411

emeat, praesertim ubi pars utraque, aut altera litigat non suo

sed alieno nomine, puta ex tutoris officio, cui congruit jus

etiam incertum non deserere. Sic Aristoteles in litibus juris ussa ιγ.
controversi, ait neutrum esse improbum, quod ipse dicit πο-
νηρόν. Cui consentiens Quintilianus posse accidere ait, nt ex usu ιι.
utraque parte orator, id est, vir bonus, dicat. Imo et juste
judicare jndicem ambigue dici ait Aristoteles, significari euim mg ιι
aut judicare ὥς δεῖ, plane ιιι oportet, sine ulla ignorantia,

aui κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γνώμην, ee· animi etti sententia. El

soonam judicaverit, ooo epit injuste.

4 At in bello rix est, ut temeritas saltem omnis et dilec-
tionis delectus absit, ob negotii ipsius gravitatem, quse omniuo
talis est, ut causis probabilibus non contenta, quam maxime
evidentes requirat.

5 At justum si accipimus, quoad effectus quosdam juris,
certum est, bellum hoc sensu justum utrimque dari, ut es iis
apparebit, qua de bello publico solenni infra a nobis dicentur.

Sic enim et sententia non ex jure lata et possessio siue jure.
habent quosdam juris effectus.

least one, litigates not on his own account, but on that of mathan as
ior instance, in consequence of the office ot guardian or trustes, whose
business it is not ιο desert a right which is only doubtful. So Aris·
. totle says that in a doubtful question of law, neither side is bad3 and
Quintilian, that there are cesos in which a good man may spenk as an
advocate on either side. Aristotle says too, that there are two senses in
which wc may say the judge judgcs rightly; the one, in which he
judges as he ought according ιο the case, not making allowance for
ignorance; the other, in which he judges sincerely as he thinks. To
do this, as he says in another place, is not to judgo nujustly.

4 But in wer it cannot easily hsppen that there is not, on one side,
ut least temerity and a lach oi churity, the matter being so gravo, that
we ought not to be content with probabilities‚ but should requiro ori-
dent causes.

6 If wc take just as to some legal effecte, it is certain thet in
this senso a war may be just on both sides 3 as will appear by what
we shall have to say hereafter of a ponal public war. So a sentence of
a judge‚ though gison not according to law, and possession without right,
hare certain legal effecte.
