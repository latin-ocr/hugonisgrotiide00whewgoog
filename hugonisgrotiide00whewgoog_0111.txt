3 In personam ejus cui juratur aetus dirigi potest tol·
lendo ab eo jus quod ei partum est3 eut etiam, si jus desit,
vetando ne quid ex tali juramento accipiat: idque duobus
modis, sive in poenam, sive ob publicam utilitatem, ex vi su-
pereminentis dominii. Atque hinc intelligi potest, si jurans
non ejusdem sit ditionis eum eo cui juratur, quid aut hujus
aut illius rectores possint cirea jusjurandum. Ipse autem qni
juratus aliquid promisit nocenti que talis est, pute piratoe, non
potest jus promisso quaesitum poenae nomine ob id ipsum ei
auferre: quia tune verba nullum haberent effectum, quod
omnino vitandum est. Similique de eausa compensari non
poterit quod promissum est, cum jure quod ante erat contro-
versum, si post motam controversiam inita pactio inerit.

of it. And on this ground may be defended the absolutione from
oeths which were formerly granted by princes3 and are now, by the
consent of princes, for the sake of piety, granted by the governors ot
the Ohureh.

3 The aet of the superior may be directed on the person oi him
to whom thenath is made, by taking from him the right which he
has thus aequired: or even, if he have no right, by forbidding that
he receive anything in virtue of such nath: and that, in two ways,
either as a penalty, or for public utility, in virtue of his Eminent
Dominion. And hence it may he understood, if the swearer be not
under the same subjection as the person swern to, what the gover-
nor ef each may do in respect to the oeth.

*He who on cath has promised anything to a mischievous person,
as such, as for instance n robber, cannot take from him the promised
right on the ground of penalty: ior then his words would have no
effect, which is by all means to be avoided.

In like manner what is promised cannot be given as a compensa·
tion fora right which was in controversy before, if the agreement took
place after the controversy began.
