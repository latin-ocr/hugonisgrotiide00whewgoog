XXVI. 1 Repugnantia casm emergentis cum voluntate
solet et ipsa ab oratoriae artis magistris referri ad eum, quem
dixi locum περὶ ῥητοῦ καὶ διανοίας. Est autem duplex: nam
aut voluntas colligitur ex naturali ratione, aut ex alio signo
voluntatis. Dijudioandae voluntati ex naturali ratione Aristo-
teles, qui hanc partem accuratissime tractavit, propriam wirtu-
tem tribuit in intellectu γνώμην, sive εὐγνωμοσύνην, id est,
oequharudeatiam, in voluntate vero ἐπιείκειαν, id est, sequi-
ἰοίην, quam sapienter definit, correctionem ejus ‘in quo
lex deficit ob universalitatem: quod ad testamenta quoque et
pacta suo modo referri debet. Nam quia casus nec praevideri
omnes possunt nec exprimi, ideo libertate quadam opus est
eximendi casus, quos qui locutus est si adesset eximeret: non
tamen temere; id enim esset dominum se faeere actus alieni;
sed ex sufficientibus indiciis.

XXVI. 1 The repugnance of an occurring case with the will
[oi the promiser] is commonly, in writers on oratory, referred to the
Section of which I hare spoken, Os wlsatia aoid aad whatie meant.
It is twofold: for the will is either collected from natural reasons,
or from some other sign of the will. Aristotle, who has most cor·
reotly treated this part, ascribes to the intollect a peculiar power for
Judging of the will, which he calls γνώμη, or εὐγνωμοσύνη, that is
spatabte incipite and to the will he ascribes a corresponding
power, ἐπιείκεια, equity, which hc ably detines, Tho correction of the
law, when it is defective from the universality of its expression*.
nnn this equity is also to be applied to testamenta and compacta in·
an appropriate manner. For since all cases can neither be foreseen
nor expressed, there is a necessity for some liberty for excepting casea
which he who has spoken would except if ho were present. But
