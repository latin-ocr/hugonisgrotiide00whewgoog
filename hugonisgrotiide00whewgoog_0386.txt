at alies esset libor, aliae ιινιιιι. Quare qui legitima musa
iu servitutem sive personalem sive civilem devenerunt, oon-

, tenti sua conditione esse dehent, ut et Paulus Apostolus docet: ¹ cent ι·

δοῦλος &hiidem μῆ σοι μελέτω· coccae ee ael servitutem?
ae id te torqueat.

XII. Neque minus iniquum armis subigere aliquos velle,
qnasi dignes qui serviant, quos naturaliter servos interdum
philesophi vocant. N on enim siquid alieni est utile, id statim
mihi licet ei pervim imponere. Nam his qui rationis habent
usum libera esse debet utilium et inutilium electio, nisi alteri
jus quoddam ιιι eos quaesitum sit. infantium plane alia est v· ςιιιιιι

ιο that man is not a slave by nature, but he Is not by nature ι erea-
tura that cannot be a slave. For in ιιὶι latter sense, no one is
free. And te this view pertains what Is said by Albutius, that No

afterwards ιο belong ιο men by their somnne. So Aristotle says,
that it is ι result os law that one man Is free, another a slave.
Thercfore they who have, by alegitimate course, corne ἱιιιο slavery,
either personal or cis-il, ought ιο be content with their conditIon; as
St Paul teaehos, Art theu called being a ιινυαιιι Cere aet sor it.

XII. Nor Ie it less unjust to wlsh to subjugate any by arms, ns
being worthy to be slaves, or as philosophare sometimes spark, natu·
rally slaves. For even if thore be anythIng which Is fit for me, it
does net follow that any ene ιιι ι rIght to impose iton me by
force. Fer those who haro the use ef resson, ought to have a free

another bave a right orer thern. 'Iho eaeo is plaInly different with
infante, ιιι government of whom, siuee they themselves have nottho
