Sic laudatur circa initia imperii O. Caesar Caligula, quod qui·

Vl. Quarto, non teneri eum ad restituendos fructus quos
percipere neglexit: quia nec rem habet, nec quicquam qnod
rei loco succedit.

VII. Quinto, si talis possessor rem sibi donatam alii
donaverit, non teneri eum nisi omnino ctiam sine hac re do·
naturus tantundem fuisset: tunc enim lucrum erit rei suae

in the beginning oi his reign, when he restored governments to per·
sons, given them also the income of tho interval elapsed.

VI. Fourthly, o boue fide possessor is not bound to restore the
produce which ho neglected to taiso; for he neither has the thing,
nor anything which has come into its place.

VII. Fifthly, isa benc fide possessor has given to another a thing
given to himself, heis not bound to restitution, exceptum any cnse,
without having this thing, ho would have given something of cqurd

VIII. Sixthly, ii hesell n thing which he hare bought (belonging
to another), ho is not bound *, except in so far as he sold it for more
than ho gave for it. If he have solda thing given to him (belonging
to another) he is held to restore the priee; except it hoppen that he
have spent tho price, aud would not otherwise have spent the money.

thing belonging to another, which we have bought bonafide, we must restore to the
owner, not requiring ssve price from hlm; according ιι the sixth, li we have bought
lt, and than sold it, we ars not bound to restore the price. lt appears to be
mmcd, in the sevsnth Buls, that ιιι have a remedy against the scllen W.
