eminentis dominii, primum requiritur utilitas publica; deinde,
ut si lieri potest compensatio fiat oi qui snum amisit, ex com-
muni. Hoc ergo sicut in rebus aliis loeum habet, ita et in
jure quod ox promisso aut contractu quaritur.

VllI. Neque ullo modo hic admittenda est distinctio quam
adierunt nonnulli, juria qnaesiti ex vi juris naturalis, 6οι ojus
quod venit ex lege civili; nam in utrumvis par jus est regis,
nec hoc magis quam illud sino causa tolli potest. Ubi enim
dominium aut jus alind alicui legitimo modo partum est, id ne
sine eausa ei auferatur juris est naturalis. Contra ai rex la·
ciat, haud dubie tenetur reparare damnum datum: iacit enim
eontra warum jus subditi. Hoc ergo differt jus subditorum ot
jus exterorum, quod jus exterorum (hoc est qui nulla ratione
subditi aunt) supereminenti dominio nullo modo subest: nam
de poena infra ridebimus: subditorum autem jus ei dominio
subest, quatenus publiea utilitas desiderat.

Βιιι ιο do thiaby the force of Eminent Dominion, thero is required, ιιι
the first place, public utility; and next, that, if possible, componantlon
be made, to him who has lost what was his, at the common expense.
And aa this holds with regard ιο other matters, se does it with regard
ιο rights which aro acquired by promise or eontract.

VIII. Nor may we, in this matter, in any way admit the dis-
tinction which some make, between rights acquired by force os Natural
Law, and those which come from tho (tivit Law. For the right of
the king orer the one elasa and the other is oqual, and tho letter can·
not, any moro than the former, be taken away without cause. For
when ownership, or any other right, has been legitimately acquired
by any one, that it may not be taken away from him without cause,
is a matter oi Natural Low. Ii tho king act in any other way, ho is
without doubt bound to ropair the damage dono: ior he acts against
the true right of the subiect In this therefore the rights of subjecta
and the rights of foreignera differ. That tho rights of foreigners, (that
is, of those who are not subjecte in any wny,) are by no means snb·
jeet to tha right of Eminent Dominion3 (whether they are subject to
Penalty, we shall heroaiter seo ς) but the rights of subJects are liable
ιο thot right, so far aa public utility demands.
