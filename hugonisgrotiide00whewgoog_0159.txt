fedus lactum erat.

2 Videndum deinde, au praeter silentium res aliqua
accesserit: nam sine re aut iacto aliquo silentium non satis
probabilem voluntatis conjecturam suppeditat, ut ex his, quae
de dominii derelictione supra diximus, intelligi potest. Sed
si aetus aliqui accesserint, qui ad aliam causam probabiliter
referri nequeant, tum recte intelligitur actus ratus esse habituss
modo probatum id quod cum Gaditanis convenerat, notat
Cicero pro Balbo. ffl-

3 Silentium adversus Carthaginienses urgebant Romani,

depactione oum Asdrubale iacta. Sed oum illa pacgio verbis &aarum
concepta esset negantibus, ne Poeni amnem Iberum transirent, '

vix erat ut silentium solum ad inducendam ratihabitionem
iacti alieni valeret, quippe cum laetum proprium nullum secu
tum esset, nisi aliquando Poenus Iberum transire volens pro-
hibitus a Romanis esset, eorumque dicto Posui paruissent:

2 We must next soe whether, besides silence, any other circum·
stauce has been added. For silence, without something or act, does
not supply a sufficiently probablo conjecturo oi the will; as may be
understood by what we haro said above, oi the dereliction oi owner·
ship. But if any act baso beon added which cannot be probably
referredto anothor causo, then the aot of consention is rightly under-
stood to be accepted as valid. And so the conventior with the Gadi·
tani was proved salid, as Cicero notes.

3 The Romans urged silence against tha Carthaginians in refer-
enee to tho consontion mado with Asdrubal. But since that conven-
tion was conceived in negativo expressions—that tho Carthaginians
should not pass tha Ebro—it was scarcely a oasa in which silence
alone could establish a ratification of the act of another: sines no act
of theirs had followed, except it might be that some Carthaginiens,
wishing to pass the libro, had been preventod hythe Romans, and
the Carthaginians hod acquieaoed: for such an act has tha force of a
positiva act, and is not merely negative. But if tho pact of Lutatius
had had more parts, and it appeared that the other parts, though
dissenting from common rule, had boon observed by the Romana, then
there would be a sufficient proof of tho confirmation of tho con·

sontion.
