possit transferri et jus in personam, autad transferendum
dominium (quod jus ipso dominio minus est) aut ad aliquid
agendum, quippe cum in actiones nostras par jus habeamus
atque in res nostras?

Add tc this, that when the will is sufficiently signissed, the owner-
ship of a thing may bc transferred, ss we heve already said: why then
may there not also be a transfer of a jus s‘n pesonam, a right to the
performance of a persen's promise, or aright to transfer ownership
(which is a less thing than owncrship itsclf,) or a right ιο do anything ς
since we hare the same right orer our actions as orer the things
which belong to us?

4 Το this is to bc added the consent of wisc men; for us it is said
by jurists‚ that nothing is so naturales that the will of the owner
when he wishes to transfer ιο οιιοιιιοι a thing which is his, should bc
held salid ς in the same way it is suid that nothing is sc congruens ιο
the mutual confidence of mankind, as to perform the agreements which
hare been made among mon. Thus the edict concerning paying
money agreed to be paid at a certain time, when in the person so
agreeing no cause had preceded except consent, is said to favour natu-
ral oquity. Paulus also says, that n man owes us a dcbt, when, jars
pectem, hc ought ιο give it ns, we relying upon his good faith3 in which
place, first, the word οιιριι implies a certain moral necessity: nor can
we admit what Gonnnnus says, that we rely upon s man’s good saith,
only when some step has been taken in agreement with the promise:
for in that place Paulus was speaking of nn action for recovering what
hes been pald and was not owing: which falls to the ςιοιιιιᾱ, ιι the
