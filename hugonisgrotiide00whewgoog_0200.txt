196 Du DAMNO PER INJURIAM DATO, ET [hm. 11.

XIX. At gentium consensu sicut introductum est, ut bella

omnia summae potestatis auctoritate utrinque gesta ct indicta

’ pro justis habeantur, quoad effectus externos, qua de re infra
dicemus: ita et hoc, ut talis belli metus hactenus pro justo

seon nv. habeatur, ne quod ita obtentum est repeti possit Atque boc

&mk sensu admitti potest distinctio Ciceronis, inter hostem, quicum

aa ’· multa jura habemus, ut ait, communia, ex gentium consensu
scilicet, et piratas ac latrones Nam hi siquid metu expres-
serunt repeti potest, nisi jusjurandum intercesserit: quod illi,

mercenariorum seditione occupatis bello denuntiato Sardiniam
insulam et pecuniam expressissent, habet naturalis aequitatis
aliquam speciem, sed ι jure gentium abit, ut alibi explicabitur.
XX. l Ex neglectu tenentur reges ac magistratus, qui
ad inhibenda latrocinia et piraticam non adhibent ea qum pos·

voluntary one.

that all wara, conducted on both sides by authority of the sorereign
power, are to be held just wars; ιο this also has been established, that
the sear of euch awai· is held a justly imposod sear, so that what is
obtained by such means cannot be demanded back. And hero the
distinction appears between an enemy and pirates or robbers '. For
what these take, may be demanded back, except an oath hare been
introduced to prevent it ς what those take, not so. Wherefore, what
appears to Polybius to be a just cause for the Carthaginians beginning
the second Punic war, that the Romans had before made war upon ·
them when thoy were engaged with the mutiny of their mercenariae,
aud had wrung from them tho island of Sardinia, and a money pay·
ment, has some sbew ofnatural equity, but is at varianae with the
Law of Nations, as we shall elsewhere explain.

XX. 1 Kings and magistrates aro liable for neglect, who do not
apply tho remedies which they can and ought, to restrain robbery and
piracy: on which ground tho Scyrinns were in ancient times eon·
demned by tho Amphictyons. I recollect tho question being pro·
posed to me,—from the fact when the rulers of our country had giren
