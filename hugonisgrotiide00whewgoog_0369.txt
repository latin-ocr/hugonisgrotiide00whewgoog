quum esse et omnium civitatum3 cui tamen mori leges pos·

teriores Romanos multum temperamenti adjecerunt. Sic cnm guam

ex delicto majoris partis, quae, ut alibi diximus, personam eliud-1²0²
universitatis sustinet, universitas iu eulpa est, eoque nomine

amittit ea quae diximus, libertatem civilem, muros, et alia
commoda, sentiunt damnum et singuli innocentes3 sed ea iu

re, qnae ad ipsos non pertinebat nisi per universitatem.

XI. 1 Praeterea notandum, interdum imponi alicui ali·
quid mali, aut boni aliquid auferri, occasione quidem alicujus
peccati alieni, sed non ita nt id peccatum eausa sit proxima
ejus aetionis, quod jus ipsum agendi attinet. Sic qui occa·
sione alieni debiti aliquid promisit, malum patitur, ex veteri
verbe, ἐγγύα, παρά d ἄτα· sponde, acaci prosto estest
proxima causa obligationis est ipsa promissio. Nam utqui
pro emtore fidejussit, non proprie eu emto tenetur, sed ex
promisso: ita et qui pro delinquente, non ex delicto, sed ex
sua sponsione. Atque hine fit quod malum illi ferendum
mensuram accipit non ex delicto alterius, sed ex potestate
quam ipsein promittendo habuit.

Lepidus should bear the some lot And this, ho says, was the ancient
custom, end common te all cities; though this custom was much
limited and tempered by tho later laws ol Romo. So when by the
delict of the general body, which, as wo heresuid, stands sor the whole
body, the whole body is in fault, and on that ground iosos, as we haro
said, civil liberty, city wells, and other adrantuges, innocent indi-
riduals slso feel the inconvenienees3 bnt they feel it in those things
which only belonged to them through the general body.

XI. 1 Itis further to be romarkod, thet sometimes a person has
herm imposed upon him, or loses good, by the occasion indeed oi
another's fault, yet not so that the fault is tho proximste cause ol the
action, so far us pertains to tho right of soting. Thus he who has
promised something on occasion oi another's dobt, suffers demago, us
the old proverb says, Suretyslip is nect door to cadelim but the
prorimnte cause ol the obligation is his promise. For as he who is
surety for a buyer, is not properly bound by the sale, but by his pro-
mise; so ho who is bound for a delinquent, is not bound by the delict,
but by his own engagement. And hence the loss which he has to
beor is messured‚ not by the other’s delict, but by the power which
ho had in promising.

2 From which it follows, that according to the opinion which we
hold for the sounder, no body can be put to doeth in virtue of surety·
ship3 because we hold thet uo oue has such right orer his own life,
