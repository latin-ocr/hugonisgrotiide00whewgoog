doli mali vox id omne significat, quod naturali juri et aequitati
repugnat.

Qui matre jubente pro filii defensore fidejussit, adver-{3¹ α mg

gessit negotium, quia contemplatione matris fidejussit: Atta-
men ex Papiniani sententia dabitur actio negotiorum gestorum

liberatur.

Sic uxori quae marito pecuniam donavit, quam ex legegtgfflr·
posset repetere, datur condictitia aut utilis vindicatio in rem mm
ex pecunia comparatam quia, inquit Ulpianus, locupletiorem

Ita friend, at the nequest of the mother, have edvauced money for
the sou’s agent, he has not properly au action against the agent, for
commission discharged or work done; nor vvas it properly the agent's
work which be did, for it vves in regard to tho mother that he gave
his money ; yet, according to Papinian, there will lie an (indirect)
action for work done, against the agent, because he has been liberated
from responsibility by the money of the friend.

Ifn wife have given money to her husband, which she could by
lavv call back again, she has an action establishiug ber claim to that
which has been bought with the money: for, says Ulpinn, it cannot be
denied that the husband is the richer by the proccedings and there
is to be an iuquiry what he possessos which is his wifo's.

If money, which my servant stolo from me, you have spent, think·
ing that it was his own property,1 have un action against you, as ifmy
property had come into your hands without any just title to it,
