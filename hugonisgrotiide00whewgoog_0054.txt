44 DE PROMISSIS. [amn

IX. Quaeri hic solet, an promissio faeta ob causam uatu-
raliter vitiosam ipsa natura raleat, ut si quid promittatur
homicidii perpetrandi causa. Ilic ipsam promissionem vitio-
sam csse satis apparet: in hoc enim adhibetur, ut alter impel-
latur ad malum facinus. Sed nou quicquid vitiose fit effectu
juris caret, quod in prodiga donatione apparet. Hoc interest,
quod donatione facta jam cessat vitiositas: nam sine vitio res
relinquitur apud donatarium. At in promissis ob cauam
vitiosam manet vitium, quamdiu non perpetratum est crimen:
tamdiu enim impletio ipsa promissi, ut mali illex, labem iu se
habet, quae cessare incipit peracto crimine. Unde sequitur
usque ad id tompus promissionis talis efficaciam esse in pen-
denti, ut modo dicebamus in promissa re quae juris nostri non
est: crimine vero perpetrato, jam obligationis vim exseri,
quse ab initio non intrinsecus defuit, sed ab accedente vitio
fuit impedita Ex hujus rei exemplum afferri potest in duda

canum Jacobi lilio, qui Thamari, quam meretricem putabat, pro·

injustitia promissarii oausam promissioni dederit, aut iuaequa-

IX. It is commonly made a question, whether a promise made
for a cause naturally ricious is ralid by Natural Law; as ir any thing
be promised for committing homicide. Hero it iseridcnt enough
that tho promise itself is ricious, for it is made that another person
may be induced to commit a crime. But what is' done viciously, is
not necessarily void, as to its jural effects; as appears by the case of a
prodigal donation. Tbere is however this differcnce ; that when the
donation is made, tho rieiousness ccases: for there isno rice in the
thing being left in the hands of the donatary. But in promises made
for a ricious cause, the rice remains as long as the crime is not pcr-
petrated= so long, the sulfilment oi tho promise, as a stimulus to
evil, has a taint in it which cesses when the orimo is committed.
Wheuee it follows, thatup to that time, the efficacy ol such apromise
is suspended, as we said abore, in speaking of promising a thing which
is not ours to give: but the crime being perpetratod, the force of the
obligatior eomes into play, haring been intrinsically in existence from
thc tlrst, but burred by tho rice which was connected with it. We
have an example of this in Judsh, who paid to Thamar her hire,
docming her a harlot.
