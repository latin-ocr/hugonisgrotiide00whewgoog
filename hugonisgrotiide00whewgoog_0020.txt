10 QUANDO IMPERIA VEL [lemn.

nude parate est responsio ad controversiam cx iacto nonnun-
quam agitatam, quo loco in conventibus sedere debeat qui
summum imperium in populum ante liberum accepite eodem
nimirumque ipse populus: sicut in Amphictyonico couscoeu
Phocensium ³locum accepit Philippus Macedo: sic vicissim qui
regis suerat locus, eum populus liber implebit.

IX. Quodsi quando quniantur duo populi, non amitten-
tur jura, sed communicabuntur, sicut Sabinorum primo, deinde
Albanorum jus in Romanos transfusum est, et uua sacta res·
publiea, ut Livius loquitur. Idemque censendum de regnis,
quae non foedere, aut eo duntaxat quod regem communem ha-
beant, scd vera unitate junguntur.

X. Contra evenit, ut quoe uua civitas luerat dividatur,
aut consensu mutuo, aut vi bellica, sicut corpus imperii Persici
divisum est in Alexandri successores. Quod cum fit, plura pro
uno existunt summa imperia, cum suo jure in partes singulus
Si quid autem commune suerit, id aut communiter est admini-
strandum, aut pro retis portionibus dividendum. Huc rese-

what answer is to ιο made ιο n controversy which sometimes arises
from circumstances ; ln what place in a couvention ought he ιο sit who
has acquired the sovereignty over a pecple free before: as in the
Amphictyonic eouncil, Philip of Macedon had the place which the
Phoceans had had. And so on the other hand, the place which had
belonged ιο ιιο king, shall bo tilled by the pecple, made free.

IX. If at any time two Peoples are united, their rights will not ιο
lost, but imparted by each ιο ιιο other; as tho rights, first of tho
Sabinos, and afterwards of the Albana, were imparted ιο the Romans,
and they wore made one republic, as Livy spealrs. Thesauro is ιο ιο
conceived ol kingdoms which are united, not by league, nor only
because they have a common lring, but joined by a real uniou.

X. It may happen, on the contrary, that what had been one State
